# Automated-Surveillance-System
In this project surveillance system is automated using motion detection technique in live video processing. Any ordinary camera can be used to capture live video stream and then that stream is processed using frame difference method to detect motion.

Alarm is triggered when motion is detected in the live video stream from the security camera. It also save pictures of the crime scene in every 2 seconds after the motion is detected. Time interval can be changed according to the requirements. An interval of 2 secs is recommended for most of the modern systems

Made using Java with Processing environment To run the file just open Automated.pde file in processing3. You can download it here https://processing.org/download/
